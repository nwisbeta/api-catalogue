overview: |
  We use Apache Solr to prvoide advanced search against patient documents in the Welsh Care Record Service.
  You can perform general searches across all document content as well as metadata, for which a standard set of fields is defined for all documents.
  Faceted search allows you to group and filter results by category until you find the document your looking for.
  The advanced search features are primarily used by the Welsh Clinical Portal to allow users to browse for relevant patient documents.
  It is available nationally and used in all Health Boards.
