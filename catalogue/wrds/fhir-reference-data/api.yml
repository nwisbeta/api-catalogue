  This API could be used to retrieve lists of practitioners, GP practices, hospitals etc., using the FHIR Organization, Practitioner and PractitionerRole resources.
  It should be considered experimental. Anybody can try out the demo/sandbox implementation and provide feedback.
  It is currently only available in the sandbox environment and not in production.
